The purpose of the files in this repo is for fast processing of single-molecule spectroscopy movies collected using a diffraction grating and CCD camera. The individual python scripts extract
the data of individual particles and their spectra from a movie and then fit it to a single gaussian. All of the data is stored in .csv files for later reference.
